# Fake-news-Classifier
Fake News Classifier Using LSTM RNN and NLP Basics
This project implements a Fake News Classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics. The classifier aims to distinguish between fake and real news articles based on their textual content.




Overview

In an era of information overload, distinguishing between authentic and fabricated news has become increasingly challenging. This project addresses this issue by leveraging deep learning techniques to automatically classify news articles as fake or real.




Features

Utilizes LSTM RNN architecture for sequential data processing.
Implements basic NLP techniques for text preprocessing.
Accompanied by training and evaluation scripts.
Provides a Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis and visualization.
Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
